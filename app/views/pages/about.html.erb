          <p>Harmony Holistic Therapies provides a relaxing, calm environment, in which you can de-stress or allow yourself some relaxation time.</p>
          <p>I believe in the importance of treating the person holistically, that is, not simply treating physical symptoms.  Prior to treatment, I carry out a consultation which allows me to get a good picture of your lifestyle, diet, general health, and current and past illnesses or injuries.  This enables me to ensure that you get the best from your treatment and to provide you with helpful aftercare advice.</p>
          <p>Holistic therapies such as Reflexology, work on the principle of energy or life force, flowing through the body.  When illness occurs, it indicates that this energy flow has become blocked and caused the disharmony.  I believe the body has it's own inner wisdom and given the opportunity, can heal itself.  It is very important to listen to the body's signals.  My objective is to empower the client to improve their health and wellbeing.</p>
